This project will permanently be in an archived state, as I have moved on to bigger projects. An updated version of this plugin can be found at https://github.com/JohnodonCode/BetterPerms


EXILED2 plugin that basically lets players with the `friendlyfirebetterperms.use` permission node enable and disable friendly fire


made so you dont have to give admins serverconfig permissions
